            <h3>Details</h3>
            <p><span class="bold">Description: </span>This planet, along with the rest of its star system, was flung out of the Triangulum Galaxy around 1 to 2 billion years ago, by either a massive black hole or supernova, or both, or neither, no one knows. It's currently somewhere in intergalactic space, speeding away from Triangulum at quite an alarming velocity. The Lonely Runaway Planet is around the same size as Mars, but close enough to its star so that it gets enough light (and not too much). In other words, it's in the habitable zone of it's star, like Earth. Its day is approximately 25 Earth hours, it has seasons as it tilts on its axis as it orbits its star, and it has 2 moons, Aurichalcum (yellow brass) and Aeramentum (red brass). There is a wide range of flora, and only a few species of fauna, but the most interesting thing to note is the large amounts of talking musical instruments on this planet.</p>
