            <h3>Welcome!</h3>
            <p>Welcome to Trombonia! This is a project of mine that I have been working on for the past few years. It started with a simple "Click the Trombone!" webpage with only a trombone button and some text, and has somehow grown to the size of this. On this page, you'll find a contents section, info about Trombonia, and links to the "documentary" pages.</p>
            <p>For updates, more info, and to read more of my ramblings, visit <a href="https://awesome-shiny-trombone.blogspot.com/">my blog!</a></p>

            <h3>About Trombonia</h3>
            <p>Trombonia is a star system, comprising of 3 rocky planets and 1 gas giant, an asteroid belt, and the Lonely Runaway Star. Why is the star called that, you ask. It's because a few billion years ago, that star was flung out of the galaxy into deep space, along with its planets. Now, the star system is quite far away from its origin in the Triangulum galaxy, somewhere in space. On one of the planets orbiting that star, there lives some trombones (and other musical instruments). "Trombonia" is the story of the lives of those musical instruments on their Lonely Runaway Planet.</p>

            <h3>The Awesome Shiny Trombone</h3>
            <p>In contrast to the aforementioned trombones, the Awesome Shiny Trombone lives right here on Earth. It lives with a trombonist, who imagines that it is sentient (it probably is). In their spare time, the trombonist also writes stories about sentient trombones in space. Sometimes they believe there are actually trombones in space, while other times they dismiss it as just a product of their imagination. Whether space trombones are real or not is a mystery that no one, the trombonist himself included, will ever solve.</p>
            <p>The trombonist lives a fairly normal life, going to school, band and orchestra practices, and playing their trombone. They have a dream of becoming a famous trombonist one day, and getting a bass trombone of their own.</p>
            <p>They publishes his trombone stories on a website, you're on it now, and writes about their own life and adventures with their possibly sentient trombone on a blog, the Awesome Shiny Trombone blog.</p>
