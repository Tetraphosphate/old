Welcome to my github. This repository has all the versions of my trombone site ("Trombonia") that I've created over the years (since 2016!!).
To view the html code as a webpage, click on a file, then click the "copy path" button on the top right corner of the page. Open a new browser tab and paste the URL into the... task bar? google search bar? omnibox? address bar? whatever it's called. That long white box on the top of your screen. The webpage should show up. I'm currently working on (read: putting off doing for as long as possible) a contents page with links to everything.
For updates, check the trombonia tag on my blog: https://awesome-shiny-trombone.blogspot.com/search/label/trombonia
