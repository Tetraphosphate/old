  <br><br>
  
  <p id="intro">That is one of the reasons why Sad Trombone is so sad.</p>
  <p>This site is primarily about trombones. That is why the URL is <a href="https://jccdragons.github.io/trombone/">https://jccdragons.github.io/trombone/</a>.</p>
  <p>Some of you might say, "<em>But why JCCDragons?</em>"</p>
  <p>This is because JCCDragons is my Minecraft username. Here is a picture of me being surrounded by pigs.</p>
  <img src="Sad Trombone_files/Pigs.png" width="500px">
  <p>Pigs are everywhere. You can find them on extreme hills, swamps, plains, etc. Just basically everywhere except oceans (and of course deep ocean biomes as well).</p>
  <p>Pigs are wall-eyed. Like being cross-eyed, except that your eyes point in opposite directions.</p>
  <p>"<em>I am fond of pigs. Dogs look up to us. Cats look down on us. Pigs treat us as equals.</em>"<span> - Winston Churchill</span></p>

  <h3 id="about">About this site</h3>
  <h4>WARNING: This site contains talking musical instruments and other unrealistic anomalies.</h4>
  <p>This site is about trombones, if you haven't figured it out already. There are stories about talking musical instruments (arrgh) and the Rad Ant (what the heck) and pictures of trombones too.</p>
  <p>A companion site to this is the <a href="www.awesome-shiny-trombone.blogspot.co.nz">Awesome Shiny Trombone blog</a>. Stories posted on the blog are sometines added to this site, but sometimes not (with really short ones).</p>

  <h3 id="how">How to use this site (and other site info)</h3>
  <p><span style="color: #f04937">This</span> colour is my favourite colour. (Message to all Americans: colour is spelt <em>colour</em>, not <em>color</em>.) Hex colour code: #f04937. RGB colour code: (240, 73, 55).</p>
  <p>The font is a default monospace font with bold. Without bold would look like this: <span style="font-weight: normal">This font has no bold. Hello. Goodbye.</span></p>
  <p>I use bold because without bold, it looks a little weird.</p>
  <p>The <a href="index.html">homepage</a> is called the Sad Trombone Hub, for reasons unknown.</p>
  <p>The trombone at <a href="#top">the top of this page</a>, when clicked, plays the sad trombone sound effect.</p>
  <p>Other clickable images include: the French horn pictures (plays the price is right losing horn effect), pictures of scores (plays whatever music the score shows), and other pictures as indicated.</p>
