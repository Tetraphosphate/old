<h3>This is Flute. She wants to start a brass band with the help of her boyfriend Interrupted Flugelhorn.</h3>
<p>"<em>Hello, everybody! I'm starting a brass band, no auditions this year, but there will be some next year. Say "I" if you are interested in joining.</em>" - Flute</p>
<br><br>
<p>"<em>I</em>" - Baritone, Bass Trombone, Euphonium, Flugelhorn, French Horn, Tenor, Sad Trombone, Trumpet, Tuba (in unison)</p>
<p>"<em>...I?</em>" - (slightly confused) TeNoR tRoMbOnE</p>

<h3>For those of you that don't know him, this is Tenor. He's (yet) another trombone.</h3>
<br><br>
<p>"<em>Let's see... So a brass band has 10 cornets, 3 tenor horns, 2 baritone horns, 2 tenor trombones, a bass trombone, 2 euphoniums, 4 tubas, 3 percussion players... BUT... we only have... an Egotistic Trumpet, a French Horn, a Flugelhorn, a Baritone, 3 tenor trombones, a Bass Trombone, a Euphonium, a Tuba, and no percussion.</em>" - Flute</p>
<p>"<em>Well... I suppose Egotistic Trumpet will have to play 10x louder, to make up for all the cornets, French Horn will have to do the tenor horn parts, Baritone and Euphonium will have to play twice as loud, Tuba four times...</em>" - Flute</p>
<p>"<em>I can do that, easy. In fact, I can be louder than all of you combined if I wanted to.</em>" - Egotistic Trumpet</p>
<p>"<em>...And TeNoR tRoMbOnE can also play a tenor horn part! Perfect! So... Here's some music for all of you guys...</em>" - Flute, handing out sheet music</p>
<p>"<em>Why did you encourage him? Last thing we need is, another AnNoYiNg EgOtIsTiC tRuMpEt!</em>" - Rest of band mutters</p>
<p>"<em>Let's see him, up against 4 trombones! (And the rest of the band.) Just, the sound of the 4 trombones (and the rest of the band) playing at fffff will be enough to make everyone deaf! As if we need that.</em>" - Bass Trombone</p>
<p>"<em>The piece we're doing today, is called Entry of the Gladiators, I'll need you all to play at fffff, because this is an ExCiTiNg PiEcE!</em>" - Flute</p>
<p>*Instruments start playing at fffff*</p>
<p>"<em>And now everyone is deaf. HuRrAy. The band has failed.</em>" - Bass Trombone</p>
<p>"<em>Wah wah wah wahhhh</em>" - Sad Trombone</p>
