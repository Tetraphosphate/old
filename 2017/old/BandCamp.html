<p>*Flugelhorn pitches a tent*</p>
<p>"<em>Ouch!</em>" - Tent Pole whacks Flugelhorn in the face</p>
<p>"<em>Double Ouch!</em>" - Tent Pole whacks Flugelhorn in the face again</p>
<p>*Tenor gives Flugelhorn a hand at pitching the tent*</p>
<p>"<em>Done!</em>" - Flugelhorn and Tenor</p>
<p>*Everybody piles into the tent and sleeps*</p>

<p>It's now morning.</p>
<p>"<em>OK, head count!</em>" - Flugelhorn</p>
<p>"<em>Egotistic Trumpet, Baritone, Tenor, TeNoR tRoMbOnE, Sad Trombone, Bass Trombone, Euphonium, Tuba, and me.</em>" - Flugelhorn</p>
<p>"<em>But that's only 9. Didn't we start off with 10?</em>" - Tuba</p>
<p>"<em>Where's French Horn?</em>" - Baritone</p>

<br><br>
<p>French Horn is eating popcorn and watching Finding Dory at his friend Mellophone's house.</p>

<h3>Mellophone</h3>
<p>"<em>What tasty popcorn you have!</em>" - French Horn</p>
<p>"<em>All the better to feed you with , my dear.</em>" - Mellophone</p>
<p>"<em>HaHaHaHaHaHaHaHa</em>" - French Horn and Mellophone</p>


<p>So French Horn was at the back of the group during the tramp, and he suddenly thought, "<em>Why don't I just ditch and go to Mellophone's for a movie?</em>". So he just ditched and went to Mellophone's for a movie.</p>
<br><br>

<p>Meanwhile, back at the campsite...</p>

<p>"<em>But he was right behind me! And I turned around, and he was gone!</em>" - Tuba</p>
<p>"<em>I'll call him to see where he is.</em>" - Flugelhorn had the sense to bring a phone</p>

<p>*Flugelhorn calls French Horn*</p>
<p>"<em>What? What do you want? I'm watching a movie, and you interrupted us, InterruptING Flugelhorn.</em>" - Annoyed French Horn</p>
<p>"<em>Well... I was just wondering where you went...</em>" - Interrupting Flugelhorn</p>
<br><br>
<p>"<em>I've really had enough of camp. Let's go home now. And this time, we'll catch the bus.</em>" - Fed Up Bass Trombone</p>
<p>*They catch the bus home*</p>
<br><br>
<p>*They arrive home*</p>
<p>"<em>Where's that tent? I think we left the tent back at the park...</em>" - Tenor</p>
